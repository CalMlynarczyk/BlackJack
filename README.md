# BlackJack

This is a portfolio project of mine. It is designed to demonstrate my
web frontend skillset. It is not necessarily made with cost-effective
development or perfect UX in mind.

The application is over-engineered.

The styling is sometimes flashy and obnoxious.

## Running the application

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn start`

### Running the application in Docker

`docker-compose up`

## Running automated tests

`yarn test`
