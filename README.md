# BlackJack

This is a portfolio project of mine. It is designed to demonstrate my
web frontend skillset. It is not necessarily made with cost-effective
development or perfect UX in mind.

The application is over-engineered.

The styling is sometimes flashy and obnoxious.

## Running the application

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
